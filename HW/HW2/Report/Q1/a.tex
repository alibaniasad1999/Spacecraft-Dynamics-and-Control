\section{Question 1}
The space shuttle weighs approximately 12.5 tons, whose thrusters can simultaneously produce a total thrust of 53400 Newtons for orbital maneuvers. Assuming that the shuttle is initially in a 300 Km (altitude) circular Earth orbit, it is desired to use a single impulse to transfer the shuttle to a 250x300 Km elliptical orbit.
